# Open Tales Brand Identity

## Company Name & Logo

**Company Name:** Open Tales

**Logo Description:** The Open Tales logo is a custom wordmark of the company name in a rounded, modern typeface (Baloo 2). Its design conveys a friendly, approachable, and cheerful feel, evoking warmth and closeness. The smooth, rounded letterforms project a casual yet trustworthy image while remaining clear and readable. This slightly playful yet professional style makes the logo versatile and welcoming.

The logo should always be presented with sufficient clear space around it to maintain impact and legibility – at minimum, leave a margin equal to the height of the "O" around all sides. It comes in two formats: a one-line version and a stacked two-line version ("Open" above "Tales"). The appropriate version should be used based on space (e.g. use the stacked logo in square or vertical spaces, and the horizontal logo when more horizontal room is available).

Consistent use of the logo in its original form and color helps maintain brand recognition. Do not stretch, recolor, or alter the logo in any way.

## Logo and Brand Hero

In addition to the text logo, Open Tales features a brand hero character – a friendly purple dragon who wears headphones and often accompanies the logo. This mascot represents the imaginative and comforting nature of Open Tales. The dragon (our "story dragon") symbolizes creativity, playful engagement, and the supportive presence of the brand.

The brand hero may appear alongside the wordmark in certain configurations (for example, the dragon's head can sit to the left of the words or above them). When using the dragon with the logo, ensure it's not scaled too small to avoid losing detail (maintain a minimum size so its features – eyes, horn, etc. – remain recognizable). The brand hero should never overwhelm the text logo; they work together to present a friendly, storybook-like identity.

## Tagline or Slogan

**Official Tagline:** "Helping kids grow without needing to heal from childhood – transforming everyday struggles into moments of connection."

This powerful slogan encapsulates Open Tales' mission. The first part, "helping kids grow without needing to heal from childhood," speaks to preventative care – ensuring children develop emotionally in such a positive way that they won't have traumatic wounds to "heal" later. The second part, "transforming everyday struggles into moments of connection," highlights how the brand turns challenges (tantrums, fears, etc.) into opportunities for parents and children to bond and understand each other.

### Usage Notes

The tagline is used in marketing materials, presentations, and the company LinkedIn profile to succinctly communicate our philosophy. It sets an empathetic and hopeful tone. When using the tagline, it can be presented as a single sentence or split into two phrases by a separator (e.g. a vertical bar or line break) as shown above. It should appear in quotation marks or stylized text to set it apart. Always capitalize and punctuate it as shown. This tagline should remain unchanged in wording; do not paraphrase it, so we maintain consistency in messaging.
