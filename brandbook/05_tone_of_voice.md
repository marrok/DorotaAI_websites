# Brand Personality & Tone of Voice

Open Tales' brand personality is warm, nurturing, and hopeful ‚Äì we present ourselves as a caring friend or guide for families. We balance professionalism (grounded in psychology) with playfulness (speaking the language of children). The tone of voice in all our communications aims to reflect this personality.

## Key Characteristics of Our Brand Voice

### Warm & Empathetic
We always speak with empathy towards both children and parents. The tone is that of a kind counselor or understanding friend. We acknowledge feelings and challenges without judgment.

For example, our messaging might say, "We know some nights can be hard ‚Äì Open Tales is here to help you and your little one find calm together." We avoid anything that might make a parent or child feel guilty or at fault. Instead, we validate emotions ("It's okay to feel angry or scared") and offer comfort.

This warmth should come through whether we're writing a social media post, a support email, or story narration.

### Encouraging & Positive
Open Tales is an optimistic brand. We focus on solutions and strengths rather than problems. The tone instills hope that things can improve.

Even when discussing serious topics (like anxiety or tantrums), we maintain a positive outlook ‚Äì emphasizing that with understanding and practice, kids can overcome these hurdles. Our language frequently includes encouraging phrases like "You can do this," "Things can get better," "Let's try this together." We celebrate small victories and progress.

Overall, the brand voice uplifts the audience, leaving them feeling empowered and optimistic after interacting with us or our content.

### Playful & Imaginative
Since we engage children, our voice has a touch of playfulness and magic. We aren't overly formal. We might use figurative language and storytelling elements even outside the stories (e.g., referring to a challenge as a "dragon to tame" or calling our newsletter the "Open Tales Chronicle").

The vocabulary remains simple and age-appropriate, especially in anything a child might hear, but we sprinkle in fun words, sound effects, or whimsical ideas to keep things light. When appropriate, we use exclamation marks or emotive punctuation to convey excitement or wonder (e.g., "Imagine a world‚Ä¶!").

That said, we strike a balance so as not to lose clarity ‚Äì playful, but not silly to the point of undermining the message.

### Knowledgeable & Trustworthy
While warm, our voice also carries the weight of expertise. We want parents to trust us as an authority on child emotional health. So, when providing advice or information, we use a confident and clear tone.

We avoid slang or anything that sounds too casual in educational contexts. We back up statements with reasoning ("Research shows that storytelling can help children process complex feelings‚Ä¶"). In our tone, this comes through as calm and steady.

We do not use fear-based language or exaggeration; we stay factual and reassuring. By being consistent and sincere, we maintain credibility. Any instructions or guidance we give is given in a supportive, "let's do this together" manner rather than commanding. This way, users know we're professional, but also on their side.

### Inclusive & Respectful
We speak in a way that is inclusive of different cultures, backgrounds, and family types. Our tone is mindful of not making assumptions (for instance, saying "parent or caregiver" instead of just "mom," acknowledging different family structures).

We also ensure our language is respectful and gentle when touching on sensitive issues. The brand doesn't stigmatize any behavior or emotion ‚Äì e.g., we would never label a child as "bad" or "naughty" in our communication; instead we talk about behaviors and feelings as things that can change.

We focus on positive descriptors and person-first language (e.g., "children with big feelings" vs. "problem children"). This inclusive tone makes all users feel welcome and understood.

## Tone of Voice Guidelines

In practice, when writing or speaking on behalf of Open Tales, follow these guidelines to maintain our tone:

1. **Use simple, clear language** that a broad audience (including non-native English speakers or young kids listening in) can understand. Avoid clinical jargon. If we need to introduce a psychology term (like "self-regulation"), we will immediately explain it in plain words.

2. **Keep sentences on the shorter side** and grammar straightforward. This ensures our content is accessible and not intimidating. For example, instead of "Utilizing narratives as a medium for cognitive restructuring and emotional regulation," we'd say "We use stories to help children learn to calm down and feel better."

3. **Address the audience with care**. Often use second person ("you") when appropriate to make it personal. For instance: "When you play an Open Tales story, your child will hear‚Ä¶". For parents, we might say "your child"; for content that a child might hear, we speak directly to the child ("Sometimes you might feel angry‚Ä¶" within a story).

4. **Maintain a gentle and patient tone**. Even when instructing (like app how-tos or tips), phrase things helpfully: "Try asking your child how they feel about the story ‚Äì you might be surprised what they share," rather than an imperative "Ask your child questions about the story." Invite rather than command.

5. **Use positive phrasing**. For example, say "Remember, every feeling is important" instead of "Don't ignore feelings." We try to frame things in what TO do, rather than what NOT to do, to keep messaging positive.

6. **Incorporate storytelling elements**. We sometimes employ narrative elements in our communications. For example, an email to users might start with a tiny anecdote or scenario, to engage them emotionally. We find this approach keeps our tone aligned with the brand (since we are a storytelling company). But we ensure even these narratives serve a clear purpose and don't obscure the message.

7. **Maintain consistency**. Whether a user is reading a social media caption, an in-app prompt, or a customer support chat, they should feel the same "Open Tales" voice coming through: caring, encouraging, and competent. We achieve this by having team members follow these tone guidelines closely and reviewing communications for tone during editing.

## Examples

### Social Media Post (Parent-facing)
"Big feelings can be overwhelming ‚Äì for kids and parents alike. üíú We get it. That's why our new story this week gently explores anger and how to turn a roaring tantrum into a calm conversation. You're not alone on this journey ‚Äì check out 'The Dragon's Calm Breath' in the Open Tales app tonight and let us know if it helps you! üêâ‚ú® #parenting #emotions"

This uses emojis and a friendly tone, acknowledges the parent's experience, and stays positive and inclusive.

### In-app Text (Child-facing, in a story)
"Sometimes Khalil felt as stormy as a thundercloud. He crossed his arms and made a grumpy face. But you know what? That's okay ‚Äì even thunderstorms pass. Let's take a deep breath with Khalil..."

Here the tone is gentle and direct to the child, validating emotions and guiding calmly.

### Customer Support Email
"Hi there! Thank you for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear the audio isn't playing correctly ‚Äì I know that can be frustrating when you're trying to enjoy storytime. Let's get it fixed so you and your child can get back to your tales. Could you try the following steps... [instructions]... Please let me know if that works or if you need more help. We're here for you! üòä"

Tone is empathetic, helpful, and personable, using first names, emoticons appropriately, and reassuring language.

By adhering to this personality and tone, we ensure that every interaction with Open Tales ‚Äì whether through our content or our team ‚Äì reinforces our brand values and makes our audience feel supported and uplifted.
