# Open Tales Target Audience

## Primary Audience

Our primary customers are parents (and caregivers) of young children who are concerned about their child's emotional well-being or want to actively foster emotional intelligence. Typically, these are parents of children roughly 3 to 10 years old – an age range where kids are learning to identify and manage feelings, and parents are looking for guidance on how to help.

This includes parents of preschoolers (dealing with separation anxiety, bedtime routines, tantrums) up through parents of early elementary-aged kids (facing issues like socialization, confidence at school, handling anger or frustration). Open Tales is designed to support families experiencing everyday challenges such as:

- Meltdowns and tantrums
- Fears (e.g., fear of the dark)
- Difficulty focusing or calming down
- Sibling rivalry
- Adjusting to new situations (like a new school or the arrival of a new sibling)

### Demographic Profile
- Ages: Typically mid-20s to 40s
- Tech-savvy: Comfortable with smartphone apps
- Parenting approach: Proactive about parenting, values positive parenting techniques
- Prior solutions: May have considered or tried traditional solutions like parenting books, children's storybooks, or even child therapy
- Priorities: Deeply care about their child's emotional development
- Time constraints: Value convenience (prefer something they can use at home or on-the-go)
- Trust factors: Prefer content created with professional input rather than random advice on the internet

## Secondary Audience

While parents are the primary users who download and pay for Open Tales, our content ultimately serves children as the end-users.

### Children
- Ages: Typically between 3 and 10
- Interests: Enjoy listening to stories
- Emotional state: May be experiencing strong feelings they don't fully understand (like intense anger, worry, or sadness)
- Response: Benefit from imaginative storytelling and often see the Open Tales dragon or story characters as fun companions or role models

The stories are tailored to be developmentally appropriate for this young audience – using simple language and scenarios a child can relate to. Therefore, when designing content or marketing, we also consider what appeals to children (e.g., colorful illustrations, friendly characters, a touch of magic) so that they will be eager to listen and learn.

### Educators and Child Professionals
Additionally, Open Tales can be useful for educators and child professionals as a supplemental resource. For instance, preschool teachers or child therapists might use Open Tales stories in group storytime or recommend the app to parents for home use. While they are not our direct customers, we keep this group in mind as influencers and beneficiaries of our product.

## Why They Choose Open Tales

Our target audience chooses Open Tales because it offers a rare combination of expert-backed content and child-friendly delivery. Parents appreciate that the stories are created by a psychologist (ensuring credibility and effectiveness), but presented in a way that their child actually enjoys (ensuring cooperation from the child).

### Key Value Propositions for Parents:
- **Time and stress savings**: Instead of figuring out what to say during a tantrum or how to teach about emotions, they can rely on a story to do it gently and effectively
- **Ease of integration**: Easy to incorporate into daily routines (for example, replacing a regular bedtime story with a therapeutic one) without feeling like a formal intervention
- **On-demand support**: Help is available whenever and wherever a tough moment arises (be it a long car ride, a meltdown before school, or winding down at night)

### Value for Children:
- **Fun and engaging**: Stories are engaging adventures, not preachy lessons
- **Relatable characters**: Children hear about characters who have feelings like theirs
- **Interactive experience**: Often interact by imagining along or answering questions posed in the tale
- **Language for emotions**: The stories give them vocabulary for their emotions and show positive resolutions

Over time, families who use Open Tales see improvements – children might start using techniques from the stories (like breathing exercises or "magic words" to calm down), and parent-child communication improves. This tangible benefit builds loyalty; our audience sticks with Open Tales because it works in making their household calmer and their child more emotionally aware.

## Audience Summary

Ideal Open Tales users are empathetic parents and curious kids. Parents are seeking supportive, educational content for emotional skills, and kids are seeking stories and comfort. Both come together with our app: the parent feels they're proactively addressing emotional health in a wholesome way, and the child feels loved and understood through the quality time spent with a story that speaks to them. This dual value proposition is what defines our target audience and drives our outreach and product design.
