# Visual Identity

Open Tales' visual identity is a cohesive system designed to be instantly recognizable and to communicate our brand's warmth, creativity, and professionalism at a glance. It encompasses our logo usage, color palette, typography, imagery style, iconography, and other design elements. Consistency in these elements is key to building trust and brand recognition, so all team members and collaborators should follow these guidelines when creating any Open Tales materials.

## Color Palette

Open Tales uses a carefully chosen color palette that reflects our brand's core characteristics and values. The colors are inviting, child-friendly, and carry emotional significance aligned with our mission (such as optimism, trust, creativity).

### Primary Colors

- **Bright Purple** – Hex: #A462FD (RGB 164, 98, 253)
  - Our signature color and the hue used in the Open Tales logo text
  - A vibrant lavender-purple that feels imaginative and approachable
  - Signifies creativity and magic, aligning with the imaginative aspect of storytelling
  - Used in headers, buttons, or anywhere we want to draw attention in a warm way

- **Deep Purple** – Hex: #5A19BF (RGB 90, 25, 191)
  - A richer, darker purple, used for contrast and secondary text or backgrounds
  - Conveys trust and stability
  - Pairs well with the bright purple
  - Can serve as a background color behind the white logo or light text

- **Magenta (Pink-Red)** – Hex: #D60066 (RGB 214, 0, 102)
  - A bold magenta/fuchsia that we use as an accent among the primary set
  - Evokes energy and optimism
  - Used for emphasis, such as icons or highlights
  - The background of our app icon is this magenta color
  - Use sparingly to accent important elements

- **Wine Plum** – Hex: #7F0445 (RGB 127, 4, 69)
  - A deep wine-purple (almost maroon) tone
  - Used for shadows, outlines, or any instance requiring a dark contrast
  - Adds depth to illustrations
  - The emotional connotation is grounded and reassuring

### Secondary Colors

- **Golden Yellow** – Hex: #F1C12B (RGB 241, 193, 43)
  - Represents optimism and positivity
  - Used to inject cheerfulness into visuals
  - Often symbolizes "light" or "hope" in our imagery

- **Sky Blue** – Hex: #557DBD (RGB 85, 125, 189)
  - Conveys trust, calmness, and clarity
  - Used in backgrounds or larger fields of color to create a soothing atmosphere
  - Traditionally signals trust and reliability

- **Lavender Light** – Hex: #DCDAFF (RGB 220, 218, 255)
  - A very light lavender (almost pastel) used as a background or neutral canvas
  - Used in presentation slides or website sections as a section background color
  - Implies gentleness and softness, reinforcing a calming feel

### Usage Guidelines

- Ensure adequate contrast for text
- Dark text (deep purple or wine plum or black if needed) on very light backgrounds
- Light text (white or light lavender) on dark backgrounds
- Avoid using all colors at once; designs are usually dominated by one or two of the primary colors with maybe one secondary as a highlight
- Each color has an emotional role: Purple = creativity/imagination, Yellow = optimism/happiness, Blue = trust/peace, Magenta = energy/joy, Deep plum = depth/stability

## Typography

Typography is an important part of the Open Tales identity, reinforcing the brand's tone through style of text. Our type choices ensure the brand's sweet and fresh message is conveyed professionally with clarity and readability.

### Primary Font: Baloo 2

Baloo 2 is a round, friendly sans-serif typeface that we use for both display (headlines) and body text in varying weights. This font was chosen for its blend of playful character and modern readability. Baloo 2 has subtly rounded letters and even some playful "pointy" details on certain characters, giving it a unique personality that matches our child-friendly yet tech-savvy brand.

#### Font Weights and Usage

- **Baloo 2 ExtraBold** – Used for Main Titles / Header 1
  - For app's splash title, major headings in documents, or large call-out text
  - Very eye-catching and sets a friendly, bold tone

- **Baloo 2 Bold** – Used for Subtitles / Header 2
  - For subheadings or secondary titles
  - Strong but more flexible in tighter spaces than ExtraBold

- **Baloo 2 SemiBold** – Used for Section Headers or Emphasis
  - For form labels, smaller headings, or to highlight text within body copy
  - Stands out from regular text without being as heavy as the main headers

- **Baloo 2 Medium** – Used for Body Text (primary)
  - For story text, descriptions, and general content
  - Easily readable for blocks of text
  - The slightly thicker strokes are friendly to the eye on screens (especially mobile)

- **Baloo 2 Regular** – Used for Body Text (secondary) or fine print
  - Used sparingly for longer form content where needed
  - For secondary information like captions, footnotes, or attributions
  - The lightest weight we use to ensure we don't go so thin that it contradicts our warm look

### Typography Guidelines

- We generally avoid italics (Baloo 2 is primarily a display font and does not have true italics in the family)
- For emphasis, use color or bolding rather than italics
- Underlines are also avoided except for hyperlinks
- For digital, ensure the font is properly embedded or web-served to avoid substitution
- For any instance where Baloo 2 might not be available (e.g., a Google Slides template or a plain email), use a fallback of a generic rounded sans-serif (like Arial Rounded or Verdana)
- Check typesetting for proper kerning and line-spacing (Baloo tends to need a bit more line height for body text due to its tall x-height)
- For children's materials (like story text on screen), bump up the font size a bit more than typical, given our young audience

## Imagery – Photography Style

Photographic imagery used by Open Tales should reinforce our brand's emotional warmth and focus on family connection. We use photos primarily in marketing materials, our website, and occasionally within the app. The style of photography we recommend is natural, candid, and positive.

### Photography Guidelines

#### Focus on Faces & Emotions
- Showcase the faces of happy, loving children and parents enjoying time together
- Capture genuine smiles, gentle laughter, or thoughtful, calm moments
- Avoid photos where subjects look distressed or upset
- Even if a story addresses anger, the accompanying imagery would likely show the resolution

#### Parent-Child Interaction
- Prefer photos that include both children and their parent(s)/caregivers in the frame
- Highlight moments of connection (e.g., a father holding a child on his lap while playing an audio story)
- Avoid images where a child is alone on a device
- The feeling should be "we do this together"

#### Natural and Relatable Setting
- Use a natural photography style and domestic settings that feel relatable
- Lighting should be soft and warm (morning or late afternoon sunlight, or cozy indoor lighting)
- Favor real home environments that look lived-in
- Avoid corporate-looking settings or anything too exotic

#### Storytime Props
- Include elements of storytelling (storybooks, stuffed animals, blankets, headphones)
- Visual cues help communicate what Open Tales is about
- Evoke a sense of comfort and routine

#### Children's Age and Diversity
- Children depicted should generally look in the 3–10 age range
- Show families of different ethnic backgrounds, cultures, and compositions
- Include images of both boys and girls, and parents of different genders
- The mood of the children in photos is mostly happy or calm

#### Screen-Free Emphasis
- Prefer screen-free photography
- Don't show a tablet or phone screen shining in the child's face
- If a device is in the shot, it should be incidental
- Center on human interaction, not technology

#### Authenticity
- Photos should feel candid rather than posed
- Capture genuine moments
- Avoid obviously posed stock-photo smiles
- Authenticity builds trust

## Illustrations, Textures & Iconography

Beyond photography, much of Open Tales' visual storytelling is done through illustrations and icons. We have a whimsical illustrative style that appears in our app UI, marketing graphics, and within story content.

### Illustration Style
- Generally flat or semi-flat style (not highly shaded or 3D)
- Bold outlines or shapes in our brand colors
- Often feature the Open Tales dragon mascot and other storybook elements
- Simple shapes, expressive eyes, and a few key details (not overly detailed or realistic)
- Consistent line style and stroke width for outlines
- Same color palette discussed earlier

### Textures/Background Elements
- Incorporate organic, irregular blob shapes as background motifs or frames
- Within these blobs, integrate small graphic symbols (stars, music notes, crown, rocket, gears)
- These textured shapes add depth and a tactile feel to our visuals
- Evoke a dreamy, creative atmosphere
- Avoid making the composition too busy

### Icons (Line Icons)
- Custom line-drawn icons for app UI and marketing infographics
- Generally in a single flat color (usually our purple or occasionally yellow accent)
- Outlined with rounded ends (no sharp spikes, to keep it friendly)
- Relatively minimal detail – just enough to be clear at small sizes
- Consistent stroke weight across the icon set
- Used in the app (like next to story categories or in the UI buttons) and in guides

### Use of Mascot in Illustrations
- The purple dragon (our brand hero) is a recurring illustrated character
- It should always look consistent: same color purple and features
- The dragon often serves as a narrator or guide figure in visuals
- When creating new illustrations that include the dragon, use the existing art as reference
- The dragon should remain friendly (never scary despite being a dragon)

### Emotion Faces & Symbols
- Custom versions of emotional faces in our style
- Simple round circles in brand colors with expressive but simple faces
- Can be used in infographics or within the app

## App Icon and Favicon

Our app icon is one of the most visible elements of our brand identity in the digital space. It's what users see in the App Store/Google Play and on their device home screens.

### App Icon Description
- Features our brand hero (the purple dragon) on a bright background
- The dragon wears pinkish-red headphones (to signify audio stories)
- Holds an open book with a yellow star and lightning bolt (symbols of imagination and energy)
- Illustrated in a circular frame with a lavender background
- The frame sits on a magenta background (hex #D60066)

### Usage Guidelines
- The same icon should be used across all platforms as the primary avatar for Open Tales
- Use for the iOS App Store, Google Play Store, and social media profile images
- Do not create alternates of the app icon without strong reason
- Maintain aspect ratio and clear resolution

### Favicon
- For our website, the favicon uses a simplified version of the app icon
- Given the small size, the dragon's face alone is typically used
- The magenta square background is retained
