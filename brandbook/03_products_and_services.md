Each package is like a toolkit on that topic: stories within a pack progress or complement each other, and often include recurring characters or settings for familiarity. Parents can choose to follow a pack over multiple nights (e.g., one story each evening) to reinforce the lessons. All stories are available as audio (for listening) and PDF text (for reading), giving flexibility in how families use them.

## 3. Personalized Story Creation (AI-Assisted)

Open Tales offers a unique AI-powered feature that allows parents (or even children, with guidance) to create personalized stories. This service, often referred to internally as the "Dora AI Assistant", uses artificial intelligence to generate custom tales based on user input.

For instance, a parent can input their child's name, select a theme (like "starting a new school" or "fear of the dark"), and add specific details (favorite characters, etc.), and the AI will craft a therapeutic story tailored to that child. This feature was designed to make the experience even more engaging and relevant – children love hearing their own names or familiar elements in a story.

All AI-generated stories still adhere to our therapeutic guidelines and are reviewed or fine-tuned by a professional to ensure they carry positive coping strategies. This not only adds a fun interactive component to Open Tales, but also extends our library infinitely, since parents can request new stories for any unique situation they encounter.

## 4. Expert Guidance & Resources

Beyond stories, Open Tales provides supporting content for parents. This includes short articles or tips within the app on how to handle certain behaviors, explanations of the psychological techniques used in our stories, and guidance on how to discuss story lessons with children.

While not a standalone product, these resources are an important part of our service, reinforcing the lessons from the tales and helping parents implement them in real life. Over time, we plan to expand this into a more comprehensive parent knowledge base (for example, a blog or in-app guide on childhood emotional development).

All guidance is written in an accessible, non-judgmental tone – much like our stories – so parents feel empowered rather than instructed.

*(Note: Open Tales currently focuses on the above digital products. We do not produce physical books or toys at this time, keeping our offerings purely within the app ecosystem. However, we may consider physical storybooks or branded merchandise in the future as extensions of the core brand, especially if it supports our mission of emotional development.)*

Support for mothers who want to respond more calmly to challenging parenting situations. You know perfectly well how important it is to communicate with your child with calm and respect. You read guides, listen to podcasts, and understand perfectly what to do when a child gets angry, screams, hits, or has a tantrum... But in emotional moments... that knowledge disappears. Because in difficult moments, old patterns and automatic reactions take over.

That's why we need something more than theory. We need to practice new, calm reactions at a deeper, emotional level.

**"Cierpliwa mama" is a series of 10 short therapeutic audio sessions containing specific psychological techniques that will help you:**
✨ Stop before you yell
✨ Stop the wave of anger
✨ Regain self-control over your reactions
✨ React less impulsively, more consciously
✨ Gain emotional distance in difficult moments
✨ Calm your body and emotions
✨ Build new, supportive patterns

This is daily, short, but very effective training of skills that are worth their weight in gold for every parent!

**For mothers who:**
💛 Feel that anger takes control over them
💛 Want to stop yelling, punishing, saying hurtful words
💛 Dream of reacting more calmly, even when it's difficult
💛 Want to break out of old patterns and create relationships based on respect
💛 Want to be the kind of mother they once needed themselves

You can learn a new way of reacting and instead of destroying your relationships, build a secure bond.
